The gnuplot utility can be used to plot binary PX14400 data:

In gnuplot:

plot "FileName" binary array=Inf format="%uint16" with lines

- Doing the above will create a plot that plots all samples in the binary 
  file name FileName. You might want to reduce the number of samples to 
  something relatively small (a few hundred samples or so).

- Certain version of gnuplot do not support Inf as an array length and must
  be provided with a concrete length.

- For other information on gnuplot, run 'help' from within gnuplot

--- 

During installation a simple script called sig_plot_16 is installed that
will plot binary single-channel PX14400 data:

 sig_plot_16 <FileName> <SampleCount>

If <SampleCount> is omitted it will be derived from file size.
