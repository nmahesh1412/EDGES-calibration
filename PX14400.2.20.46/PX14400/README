Signatec PX14400 software support for Linux

This document contains requirements and installation instructions for local
Signatec PX14400 software support. The `doc' directory contains more
information relevant to using and developing for the device.

--------------
Requirements

Signatec recommends systems utilizing Intel based “workstation/server” class
 chipsets and CPUs for best performance with Signatec products with
 components such as:

 • Intel Xeon 5400/5500/5600 Series CPUs
 • Intel 5000P/5000X/5400/5500/5520 Series based Chipsets
 • 8+ GB of Total System RAM
 • Motherboards utilizing dedicated (non-shared bus) PCI-X 64-bit slots or
   PCI-Express (PCIe) x8/x16 slots that match desired Signatec product model
   board’s interface.
 • Note, high-end graphics cards are not necessary for Signatec board
   operation.
 • For high-speed data storage, high-performance RAID cards with a PCIe based
   interface that can connect multiple high-performance SATA/SAS hard drives
   in a RAID level configuration.

Please note that Signatec products are capable of operating with lower end
 "desktop" class systems as well; they just may not be able to utilize the
  maximum data transfer performance rates that Signatec products are capable
  of reaching as these lower end class systems typically use less performance
  based chipsets and interconnections limiting the bandwidth of the
  interfaces.

The PX14400 requires the following "minimum" hardware configuration:
 • The availability of 1 open PCI Express (PCIe) x8 or x16 slot on the system
   motherboard for PX14400 board installation.
   o Note: Some motherboards have "mechanical" PCIe x8 or x16 slots that
     actually operate "electrically" at slower PCIe x4 rates. The PX14400 is
     capable of being operated in such slots, but its maximum transfer rate
     will be reduced by the slower PCIe x4 connection.
 • 4GB of system RAM
 • Intel Core Series CPU

This driver supports the following Linux distributions: 
 Red Hat 7.0 	(64-bit)
 Ubuntu  16.04	(32-bit and 64-bit)
 
------------------------
Installation and setup

1. Unzip the PX14400 tarball (px14400.X.YY.tar.gz) into its new home.
   (Where X.YY is the release version.) This can be done by copying the
   tarball into the directory that you want it installed to and running
   'tar -xzvf px14400.X.YY.tar.gz' from a console (in that directory).

2. You must be running the kernel on which your PX14400 software will be
   running.

3. Compile both the driver modules and the libraries by running 'make'
   from the PX14400 directory.

4. Install the required files by running 'sudo make install'. This will
   copy and/or register modules and shared libraries.

5. Run 'lsmod|grep sig_' to verify that the kernel mode driver module has
   been loaded; you should see output similar to
      sig_px14400             34412  0
   if it has been loaded successfully. If nothing is shown on the terminal,
   load the kernel mode driver by running 'sudo modprobe sig_px14400';
   verify its status using the lsmod-command again. You may want to use
   the scripts in the load_scripts directory to explicitly load or unload
   the PX14400 driver in the future.

6. Compile example and/or utility applications by running 'make example'.
   This will compile all example/utility applications. This step needs to
   be done after step 4.

--------------------
Installation Notes

* ATTENTION RED HAT or FEDORA CORE USERS **:

 The PX14400 shared library (libsig_px14400) is installed to /usr/local/lib/.
 Some Red Hat distributions do not have this directory listed in the library
 loader's search path. This results in the library not being able to be found
 by the shared library loader. (Client PX14400 software will fail to build due
 to linker errors.) To fix this (you will need to be root):

 1. Add '/usr/local/lib' to the /etc/ld.so.conf file. (Just add it to the
    bottom of the file.)
 2. Run ldconfig. This can be done from any terminal and will not require any
    further input. (It just applies the change made in the previous step.)
 3. The PX14400 library should now be visible to the loader after a 'make
    install'.
