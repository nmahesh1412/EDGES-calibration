This application demonstrates how to do a PX14400 RAM-buffered PCI 
acquisition recording. This type of recording acquires data directly to the
PCIe bus, using the onboard PX14400 RAM to buffer the data.

By default, data is not saved to disk. To save data to disk, pass a filename
on the command line.

Pressing 'S' at runtime will have the program copy a snapshot of the current
recording data to file 'SNAPSHOT.rd16'. The 'sig_plot_16' script can be used
to plot this data using gnuplot if it's on you system.
