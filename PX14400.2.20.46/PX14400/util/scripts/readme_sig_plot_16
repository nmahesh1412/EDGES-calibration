The sig_plot_16 is a small script that will plot PX14400 acquisition data
using the gnuplot utility that is present on many Linux systems.

Usage: sig_plot_16 <FILE>
Where <FILE> is the pathname of the file to plot.

Running the script will launch gnuplot and tell it to plot the data. Note that
gnuplot will plot the whole file so if it's a really large file, you may want
to extract out a smaller piece of the file to view. 

To exit gnuplot, just type 'quit'. This will close the file plot if it is
still open
